## About Me

**Will Cushen** is a Senior Consultant at Red Hat. His days are spent supporting customers in their containerisation journeys with OpenShift and getting acquainted with emerging technologies in the Kubernetes ecosystem. 

On top of that, he's a competent (Ansible) automater of things and a co-author of an Australian security benchmark for Red Hat Enterprise Linux as part of the [ComplianceAsCode](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode) project. 

_And_ for kicks, he's usually out experiencing the world on his bicycle every chance he gets :bicyclist:

This blog will serve as a spot for a tell-all of things I'm working on professionally or kicking the tires on at home - as a way to give back to the immense knowledge bank on the web, contributed to by very smart people that I'm benefiting from everyday. I've defaulted to the path of least resistance in standing up this blog, using a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static theme by [@huabing](https://github.com/zhaohuabing) hosted on AWS Amplify. There's lots to dig about the ease of both which I'm really enjoying. 

If you have any questions or would like to chat, email and Slack are the best places to reach me!
